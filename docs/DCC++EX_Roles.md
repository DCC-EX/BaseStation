**DCC++EX provides a low cost flexible solution using readily available microprocessors create a  Digital Command & Control (DCC) Command Station to control a model railroad.**  

**DCC++EX users fall into three main roles.  The roles are organized based on what a user wants to do with DCC++EX. Don't worry, the roles are integrated and you can switch to another role whenever you want. See which role you best identify with:**

# Engineer (or Operator) (hat logo?)- is for the DCC++EX user who to enjoy running trains. 
You could be someone new to the hobby or somewon picking the hobby up again after a long absence. Or you maybe a model railroader who is currently running a DC Rail Road and is looking to switch over to DCC. DCC++EX provides you with a low cost  "out of the box" working solution that gives you a Command Station and a Controller which you can setup and get running in just a few minutes. 

As an DCC++|EX Engineer,you just want to drive trains and don't want to have to deal with the detail of the hardware or software involved. This role keeps  things simple.  This is the perfect place for someone who just wants wants to have a holiday set or to spend time enjoying a model railroad with a child. 

Once you are running your RR with DCC++ EX, you may want to learn more about the Java Model RailRoad Interface (JMRI). JMRI is another application that allows you to control additional features of your model RR. JMRI may be your next step in controlling your locomotive and operating your switches.

# Tinkerer (or Maker) (gear logo?)- likes the joy of putting things together themselves or learning how things work. 
Tinkerers are those of you who are willing to follow instructions to place jumper wires on pins or use a soldering iron.  Although they are not experts in software development, they don't have a problem opening a file to change settings in the software and uploading it back to their Command Station. 

Tinkerer Role covers more options than our Engineer Role.  If you want more power, or want to control of turnouts, sensors and other accessories this may be the role you you.

Deveopers have a desire to dig a deeper into how things work. They either  understand the basics of programming or want to learn how to program. As a Developer you will need to look at source code and make changes.  This role offers detailed technical information and covers in deptch topics such as accessory control, customizing system to add unique features or hardware.  

Developers use GitHub and are not averse to experimenting with things like using a different motor board and following a schematic or instructions to solder a transistor or two to make something work.
