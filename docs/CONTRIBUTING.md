Thanks for considering contributing to our project. Here is a guide for how to get started and and a list of our conventions. We will also walk you through the Github command line and Desktop commands necessary to download the code, make changes, and get it included in a next version of the sofware.

## Development Platform

We are using Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO. You need to install Microsoft's FREE Visual Studio Code and the FREE PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code. From PlatformIO install the C++ extension. You may also want to install the Clang extension. Under "Platforms", make sure you have "Atmel AVR" installed so you can connect to Arduino boards.

## Code Formatting

We are using the "Visual Studio" C++ code formatting standard. Make sure in your Settings file that the C_Cpp:Clang_format_fallback Style is set to "Visual Studio". Then when you right click and select "Format Document" (or use the Alt-Shift-F shortcut) your code will be standardized to the DCC++ EX style.
