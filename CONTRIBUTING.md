# Development Environment

We recommend using PlatformIO IDE for VSCode. If you haven't yet used it, it is an easy to learn and easy to use IDE that really shines for embedded development and the Arduino based hardware we use. For more information go to https://platformio.org/

# Coding Style Guidelines

We have adopted the Google style guidlines. In particular please make sure to adhere to these standards:

1. All header files should have #define guards to prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the symbol name should be <PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H
2. Use Unix style line endings
3. We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
4. Braces

For more information just check our code or read https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#C++_Version

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
